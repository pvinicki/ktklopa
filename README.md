# KTKLOPA


## SUMMARY
Ktklopa is a website containing information about restaurants in Kutina. It contains
contact information and menus of each restaurant. It implements a Login/Register system and a mySQL database.

The website is currently hosted [here](https://ktklopaa.000webhostapp.com/). 

## ABOUT
This website was made as a faculty project whose goal was mainly learning HTML, CSS, JS and PHP. I wanted to make something that could have real world applications and be useful. With those goals in mind i decided to develop this website hoping it would make the decision making process of ordering food much easier with all the info compiled in one place.

The main page displays different restaurants, selecting a restaurant opens a page detailing the restaurants offers (Note that only the "Bistro Servus" restaurant has a detailed description implemented).

The "Klopa" site is not working due to the local db being lost to time. While active it would allow filtering and searching for food items from all restaurants.
